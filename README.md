# Real Estate Data Analysis and Visualization Project

This project involved cleaning a dataset from Kaggle about real estate in the United States, exploring the data using BigQuery SQL, preparing the data for visualization in Power BI, and creating comprehensive dashboards.

## Files:
- `data_cleaning.sql`: SQL code for cleaning the dataset (reduced data volume by about 9x).
- `data_exploration.sql`: SQL code for exploring the dataset in BigQuery.
- `real-estate-dashboards.pbix`: Power BI file containing the dashboards.
- `real-estate-dashboards.pdf`: PDF export of the Power BI dashboards.

## Dashboards:
1. **Property Stats Dashboard**: Provides interactive statistics on property listings.
2. **Price Calculator**: Calculates average property prices based on given parameters.
3. **Sales Distribution Dashboard**: Displays the quantity of sold properties across different states and the distribution of sales by month.

## Skills Used:
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and reduced the dataset by about 9 times using SQL.
- **Data Exploration**: Conducted thorough data analysis using SQL in BigQuery.
- **Data Visualization**: Grouped and transformed data for clear presentation in Power BI.
- **Analytical Thinking**: Developed insights to support data-driven decision-making.

## Hard Skills:
- **BigQuery SQL**: Used for data cleaning and exploration.
- **Power BI**: Used for data transformation and dashboard creation.

## Results:
- Reduced data volume by ~90%.
- Created 3 interactive dashboards for property statistics, sales trends, and pricing calculations.
